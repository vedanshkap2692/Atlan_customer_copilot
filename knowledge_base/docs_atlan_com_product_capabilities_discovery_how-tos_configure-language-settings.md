How does Atlan speak to you? Decide for yourself! Atlan enables you to customize language settings from the default English to your preferred language at a workspace level.

Atlan admins can change the default language for their Atlan workspace from the admin center. Individual users can also set a personal language preference, which overrides the default workspace settings - English or otherwise.

Atlan currently supports the following additional languages:

French

Japanese

Portuguese

To enable any of the additional supported languages or request ones not listed in this section in your Atlan workspace, Atlan admins mustcontact Atlan support.
