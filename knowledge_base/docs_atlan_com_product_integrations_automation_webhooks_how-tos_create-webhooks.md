Create webhooks

You will need to be an admin user in Atlan to create webhooks.

If your webhook endpoint is behind a VPN or firewall, you must add the Atlan IP to your allowlist. Please raise a support ticket from within Atlan, orsubmit a request.

Webhooks allow you to monitor events happening in Atlan, receive notifications for these events to a URL of your choice, and take action right away. For example, you can create a webhook to send notifications to your email address or messaging app when atermis updated or an asset istagged.

Webhooks send the payload in a specific format that cannot be customized. This is meant for consumption by a programmatic entity down the line   -  for example, AWS Lambda or a microservice. For a webhook to be consumed directly, Atlan will need to customize the payload, which is currently not supported. Alternatively, you can explore out-of-the-box integrations such asSlackandMicrosoft Teams.

Atlan currently supports creating webhooks for the following event types:

Asset creation, deletion, and metadata update

Custom metadata update for assets

Tag attachment or removal from assets
