## Retrieve lineageÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

2.5.33.1.1

To fetch lineage, you need to request lineage from Atlan from a particular starting point:

1234567891011

FluentLineage.builder(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (1).depth(1000000)// (2).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.DOWNSTREAM)// (3).pageSize(10)// (4).includeOnResults(Asset.NAME)// (5).immediateNeighbors(true)// (6).stream()// (7).forEach(result->{// (8)// Do something with the result});

FluentLineage.builder(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (1).depth(1000000)// (2).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.DOWNSTREAM)// (3).pageSize(10)// (4).includeOnResults(Asset.NAME)// (5).immediateNeighbors(true)// (6).stream()// (7).forEach(result->{// (8)// Do something with the result});

Build a request for lineage with the starting point for your lineage retrieval (theGUIDof an asset). If you already have an asset, you can also instead runrequestLineage()on the asset to directly build the same request.

requestLineage()

You can specify how far you want lineage to be fetched usingdepth(). A depth of1will only fetch immediate upstream and downstream assets, while2will also fetch the immediate upstream and downstream assets of those assets, and so on. The default value of1000000will fetch upstream and downstream assets up to 1,000,000 hops away (basicallyalllineage).

depth()

1

2

1000000

You can fetch only upstream assets or only downstream assets. In the list API, you cannot access both directions at the same time.

You can specify how many results to include per page of results (defaults to 10).

You can also specify any extra attributes you want to include in each asset in the resulting list.

To include details about which asset is upstream and downstream of which other asset, setimmediateNeighborstotrue. (Without this, all downstream assets will be listed in breadth-first order, but you will not know specifically which asset is downstream of which other asset.)

immediateNeighbors

true

You can then directly stream the results from the request. These will be lazily-fetched and paged automatically.

A normal JavaStreamis created, so you can apply any stream-based operations to it (filtering, mapping, collecting, or doing something for each result as in this example).

## Traverse lineageÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

The new lineage list API returns results in breadth-first order. So you can traverse the lineage by progressing through the result list in the order they are returned, even across multiple pages of results.



### Downstream assetsÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

2.5.33.1.1

To traverse downstream assets in lineage:

12345678910111213

FluentLineage.builder(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (1).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.DOWNSTREAM)// (2).immediateNeighbors(true)// (3).stream()// (4).filter(a->!(ainstanceofILineageProcess))// (5).limit(100)// (6).forEach(result->{// (7)// Do something with each resultfor(LineageRefref:result.getImmediateDownstream()){// (8)StringdownstreamGuid=ref.getGuid();// (9)}});

Specify theGUIDof an asset for the starting point. (Or from an asset itself, userequestLineage()to start the same builder.)

requestLineage()

Request theDOWNSTREAMdirection.

DOWNSTREAM

If you want to understand specifically which assets are downstream from which other assets, setimmediateNeighborstotrue.

immediateNeighbors

true

You can then stream the results from the request. The pages will be lazily-fetched in the background, as-needed.

With streams, you can apply additional filters over the results (in this example any processes in the results will be ignored).

With streams, you can also limit the total number of results you want to process â independently from page size of retrievals. With lazy-fetching of the results, this will ensure you only retrieve the number of pages required to complete the stream.

Of course, you still need to actually do something with those remaining results.

IfimmediateNeighborsistrue, each asset will have a list of downstream lineage references populated in.getImmediateDownstream().

immediateNeighbors

true

.getImmediateDownstream()

You can, for example, retrieve the GUID of each of these downstream references to see the assets that are immediately downstream from the asset you are iterating through in the lineage results.

## Filter lineageÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

You can also filter the information fetched through lineage. This can help improve performance of your code by limiting the results it will fetch to only those you require.

Retrieve only active assets

In most cases for lineage you only care about active assets. By filtering to only active assets, you can improve the performance of lineage retrieval by as much as 10x. (The newFluentLineageinterface will do this automatically, unless you explicitly request the inclusion of archived assets.)

FluentLineage

Not possible to filter by custom metadata

You currently cannot filter lineage based on the values of custom metadata.



### Limit assets in responseÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

1.9.54.0.0

You can limit the assets you will see in the response through entity filters. These restrict what assets will be included in the results, but still traverse all of the lineage:

123456

List<Asset>verifiedAssets=Asset.lineage(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (1).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.UPSTREAM).includeInResults(Asset.CERTIFICATE_STATUS.inLineage.eq(CertificateStatus.VERIFIED))// (2).includesCondition(FilterList.Condition.AND)// (3).stream()// (4).collect(Collectors.toList());// (5)

List<Asset>verifiedAssets=Asset.lineage(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (1).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.UPSTREAM).includeInResults(Asset.CERTIFICATE_STATUS.inLineage.eq(CertificateStatus.VERIFIED))// (2).includesCondition(FilterList.Condition.AND)// (3).stream()// (4).collect(Collectors.toList());// (5)

Build the request as you would above, or request it directly from an asset. Because this operation will directly request lineage for the asset in Atlan, you mustprovide it anAtlanClientthrough which to connect to the tenant.

AtlanClient

Add one or moreincludeInResultsto the request before sending it to Atlan. Each of these defines criteria for which assets should be filtered for inclusion in the results, in this example only assets with a verified certificate will be included. The criterion itself is composed of:The field by which you want to filter (Asset.CERTIFICATE_STATUSin this example).A fixed member within that field that builds lineage filters, called.inLineage.The operator you want to use to compare values for that field in order to determine whether or not an asset matches (.eq()in this example).The value you want to compare against using that operator (CertificateStatus.VERIFIEDin this example).

When you then stream the results, only those assets that match the filter criteria will be included in the response.

You can then collect them (standard stream operation) to give a complete list, across pages, of those assets that match the criteria.

### Limit lineage traversalÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

1.9.54.0.0

You can also limit how much of the lineage is traversed. You can do this both at an asset-level and a relationship-level:

12345678

List<Asset>activeAssets=Asset.lineage(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799").direction(AtlanLineageDirection.DOWNSTREAM).whereAsset(FluentLineage.ACTIVE)// (1).assetsCondition(FilterList.Condition.AND)// (2).whereRelationship(FluentLineage.ACTIVE).relationshipsCondition(FilterList.Condition.AND)// (3).stream()// (4).collect(Collectors.toList());// (5)

List<Asset>activeAssets=Asset.lineage(client,"495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799").direction(AtlanLineageDirection.DOWNSTREAM).whereAsset(FluentLineage.ACTIVE)// (1).assetsCondition(FilterList.Condition.AND)// (2).whereRelationship(FluentLineage.ACTIVE).relationshipsCondition(FilterList.Condition.AND)// (3).stream()// (4).collect(Collectors.toList());// (5)

Provide your conditions to thewhereAssetandwhereRelationshipof the request. This will ensure that once an asset (or relationship) is found in lineage traversal that doesnotmatch the conditions, further lineage traversal beyond that asset (or relationship) will not be done.In this example, that means that once we hit an archived or soft-deleted asset (or relationship) in the lineage, we will not look for any further downstream lineage from that archived or soft-deleted asset (or relationship). (In other words, we will limit the lineage results to only active assets by short-circuiting traversal when we hit an archived or soft-deleted asset or relationship.)FluentLineage.ACTIVE constantNote that theFluentLineage.ACTIVEexample here is a predefined filter constant. If you look at its code, it is equivalent to writing any other lineage filter:Asset.STATUS.inLineage.eq(AtlanStatus.ACTIVE)When you request lineage directly on an asset, as in the example above, by default only active assets and relationships are included. (In other words, the filters byFluentLineage.ACTIVEare applied by default when using theAsset.lineage()request style.)

## Original APIÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/snippets/common-examples/lineage/traverse/)

Deprecated and removed

The original lineage API was previously deprecated, and now no longer exists in the latest releases of the SDKs. It is slower, does not support paging, and will not receive any enhancements. We would therefore strongly recommend using the newer API (described above); however, the original API is described here for completeness.

To fetch lineage, you need to request lineage from Atlan from a particular starting point:

12345678

LineageRequestrequest=LineageRequest.builder()// (1).guid("495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (2).depth(0)// (3).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.BOTH)// (4).hideProcess(true)// (5).allowDeletedProcess(false)// (6).build();// (7)LineageResponseresponse=request.fetch();// (8)

LineageRequestrequest=LineageRequest.builder()// (1).guid("495b1516-aaaf-4390-8cfd-b11ade7a7799")// (2).depth(0)// (3).direction(AtlanLineageDirection.BOTH)// (4).hideProcess(true)// (5).allowDeletedProcess(false)// (6).build();// (7)LineageResponseresponse=request.fetch();// (8)

Build aLineageRequestto specify the starting point for your lineage retrieval.

LineageRequest

The starting point for lineage must be theGUIDof an asset.

You can specify how far you want lineage to be fetched usingdepth(). A depth of1will only fetch immediate upstream and downstream assets, while2will also fetch the immediate upstream and downstream assets of those assets, and so on. The default value of0will fetchallupstream and downstream assets.If you expect extensive lineage, change the default!The default value of0can result in a long-running API call with a very large response payload. If you expect your lineage to be extensive, you may want to try smaller depths first.

Multiple API calls

You may either need to make multiple API calls using the approaches above, or retrieve all downstream lineage and in your code traverse the returned relationships.

Keep in mind that when we say "all" above we mean all assets that are foundin the response. If you have modified your request parameters to limit the lineage (for example, throughdepth()ordirection()) then this will only traverse what is found in the response â not necessarily all lineage in Atlan.
