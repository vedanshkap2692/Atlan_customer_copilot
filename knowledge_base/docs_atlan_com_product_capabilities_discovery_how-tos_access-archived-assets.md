ollowing steps.



## Archived assetsâ
(source: https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/discovery/how-tos/access-archived-assets#deleted-assets)

Archived assets still exist in Atlan. They are only "soft-deleted" and do not appear in search results (by default). You can only access archived assets through discovery.

Assets can be archived when:

You lose permissions to an asset at source.

The asset name is changed at source.

An asset is removed at source or moved to a different schema or database.

Delete your assets either bydeleting a connectionorconfiguringit in Atlan.



### Search for archived assetsâ

From the left menu of any page, clickAssets.

UnderFilterson the left, expandProperties.

At the bottom of the list of properties, clickIs Archivedand thenYes.

Nowuse any additional filters, and the results will include only archived assets.



### View details of an archived assetâ

To view the details of an archived asset:

Search for the asset using the steps above. Narrow down your results using the other filters or search details.

Click the card for the asset you want to view.
