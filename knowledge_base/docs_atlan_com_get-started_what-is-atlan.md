What is Atlan?

We are a modern data workspace that makes collaboration among diverse users like business, analysts, and engineers easier, increasing efficiency and agility in data projects.

We started out as a data team, solving social good problems using data science. We built Atlan for ourselves over the course of 200 data projects, which included India's national data platform used by the prime minister and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations.

Atlan helped us build India's national data platform with an 8-member team, making it the fastest project of its kind to go live in just 12 months  - instead of the projected three years.



## Why we built Atlanâ

Data teams can be diverse: analysts, scientists, engineers, and business users. Diverse people with diverse tools and skillsets mean diverse DNAs. All of it led to chaos, which made our Slack channels look like this...



### We call this "collaboration overheard"â

We knew we couldn't scale like this, there had to be a better way. We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams. We then experimented for two years and across 200 data projects to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. We call thisDataOps.
