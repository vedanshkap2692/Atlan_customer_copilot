There are no additional costs incurred during implementation. To support the user/process transformation within your organization, Atlan provides an optional Accelerator Package with cultural enablement services.

In terms of individuals and responsibilities required to run and maintain Atlan, both may vary depending on the following two factors:

Size of your organization (10, 100, 1000 users).

Typically, the application is owned by at least 1 data engineer persona and 1 persona responsible for data governance, data enablement, and information architecture. You'd only be in charge of managing data source integrations because Atlan is deployed as software as a service (SaaS).
