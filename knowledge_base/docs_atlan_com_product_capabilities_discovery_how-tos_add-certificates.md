Add certificates

How many times has someone complained to you that the data is incomplete or has issues? And how many times have you responded that it's still a work in progress or they're using the wrong data!

Wouldn't it be really convenient if the data could answer these questions?

Certificates in Atlan can help! The certification tags help users quickly identify whether a data asset is ready to use, a work in progress, or has some issues.

You can add the following four certification tags to any data asset:

Verifiedfor ready to be used.

Draftfor work in progress.

Deprecatedif the asset no longer exists.

No certificateif not required or needs documentation down the line.

Certificates can be used to quickly filter data assets on theAssetspage. This helps build trust in your data assets among users.
