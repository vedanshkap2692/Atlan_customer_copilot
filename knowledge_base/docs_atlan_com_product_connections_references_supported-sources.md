At Atlan, we have two core philosophies on integrations:

Simple setup with out-of-the-box connectors.In three steps, you'll have your sources connected, with activity logs and automatedSlackorMicrosoft Teamsalerts for easy monitoring.

Extensible throughOpen APIs. We've built Atlan on an Open API architecture, so every action on Atlan can be driven by APIs. This means you can bring in any data product you want, from any source.
