Pipelining

Running example

To walk through this using an example, and to compare and contrast the approaches, imagine you want to:

Mark all views (including materialized views) in a particular schema as verified, unless they already have some certificate.

Change the owner of the same views.



## Step-by-stepÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/patterns/bulk/end-to-end/)

The usual end-to-end pattern for updating many assets efficiently involves three steps:

Finding the assets you want to update.

Applying your updates to each asset (in-memory).

Sending those changes to Atlan (in batches).

You can do each of these steps in sequence, for example:



### 1. Find the assetsÂ¶
(source: https://developer.atlan.com/patterns/bulk/end-to-end/)

1.4.01.1.0

You start by first finding the assets you want to update. This is usually best done through asearch. (For other common examples, have a look at thesearch snippets.)

ThequalifiedNameof every view starts with thequalifiedNameof its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using thequalifiedName.

You can chainwhere()methods to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the static constants within any given type to select a particular attribute (likeQUALIFIED_NAMEin this example), and then limit results to only those assets whosequalifiedNamestarts with thequalifiedNameof the schema (by using thestartsWith()predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results.

Every asset implements thetrimToRequired()method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset.Limit your asset to only what you intend to updateWhen you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request â leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By usingtrimToRequired()you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details youdowant to update.

You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch.Auto-saves as it goesAs long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch. As soon as you hit the size limit for the batch, though, this same method will call thesave()operation to batch-update all of those assets in a single API call.Remember to flushSince your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember toflush()the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size.

You need to specify the type for each asset you are updating.

You need to specify other required attributes for each asset, such as its name and qualifiedName.

Add on any other attributes or relationships you want to set on the asset, such as in the running example a verified certificate and new individual owner.

Add another object to the payload to represent another asset that should be updated by the same API call. Once again specify all the required information for that kind of asset, and any of the details for attributes or relationships you want to set.

Every asset implements thetrimToRequired()method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset.Limit your asset to only what you intend to updateWhen you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request â leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By usingtrimToRequired()you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details youdowant to update.

trimToRequired()

Limit your asset to only what you intend to update

When you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request â leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By usingtrimToRequired()you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details youdowant to update.

trimToRequired()

In this running example, you are updating the certificate to verified and setting a new owner â so you simply chain those updates onto the trimmed builder.

You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch.Auto-saves as it goesAs long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch. As soon as you hit the size limit for the batch, though, this same method will call thesave()operation to batch-update all of those assets in a single API call.Remember to flushSince your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember toflush()the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size.

Auto-saves as it goes

As long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch. As soon as you hit the size limit for the batch, though, this same method will call thesave()operation to batch-update all of those assets in a single API call.

save()

Remember to flush

Since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember toflush()the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size.

flush()

Both the.add()and.flush()operations of theAssetBatchcould send a request over to Atlan. Either can therefore also run into trouble and raise an error through anAtlanException. It is up to you to handle such potential errors as you see fit.

Requires numerous API calls

To implement the same logic purely through raw API calls will require making many calls:

To run the search.

To page through the results.

To batch up a set of assets to update.

To submit each batch of assets to update.
