What is a glossary?

A glossary is a list of terms that is organized in a specific way to help users understand their data assets. For example, terms likecost,P&L, andrevenuecan be used to group and search all financial data assets.

cost

P&L

revenue

Using familiar terminology helps people quickly understand the data and its context. This is a crucial element of data governance since it adds business context to the data initiatives of an organization.

In Atlan, glossary terms can be attached to any data asset and leveraged to power quick and easy data discovery.



## Why do I need a glossary?â
(source: https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/glossary/concepts/what-is-a-glossary#category)

In today's diverse data teams, which include people from different backgrounds and use cases, not all of them think about their data in the same way.

For example, one team might think that a particular metric is showing an annualized rate, but the actual rate may be calculated quarterly. This could lead to some real confusion down the road. Defining data terms and sharing those definitions across your team can make a huge difference to data users at all levels of the organization.

For teams made up of data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers, having a shared language is an important step towards ensuring better collaboration. Building a glossary allows your team to define the metrics, columns, and assets with the same meaning for everyone.

Atlan gives users the option to build hierarchical glossaries. A glossary term is the lowest unit that can exist independently inside a glossary. These terms can then be grouped into categories and linked together as related terms.

This structure allows for glossaries from multiple domains.

Let's look at how terms and categories work together to build a glossary.



### Termâ

A term is the lowest unit that is unique to each glossary.

It describes the content of the data assets in a useful and precise way.

It can exist independently, without belonging to any particular category or subcategory.

### Categoryâ
