Purposesare where you can build policies based on the actions or access that a user might need. For example, you can use Atlan's policy-based access controls to manage access to PII and other sensitive data. This is a best practice for data governance.

Once you set these policies, Atlan will enforce them throughout your users' experience. This means that users who don't have access to a particular type of data will not be able to see it.
