Create data domains

Before you can create a data domain, you will need your Atlan admin toenable the products module in your Atlan workspace. Once enabled, first review theorder of operations. You will need to be adomain owner or domain admin in Atlanor have access throughdomain policiesto create and manage data domains. If you do not wish to enable the products module but still want to create domains in Atlan, refer toHow to manage domainsinstead.

Data domains provide a logical way of grouping data products within a specific domain or business entity   -  for example, functions like finance and sales, business units for different products and services, regions of operation, and more. Most importantly, data domains help in fostering collaboration and promote shared ownership and domain-level governance in your organization.

Data domains in Atlan take true meaning from:

Key stakeholders of a specific domain and their roles

Data products within that specific domain
